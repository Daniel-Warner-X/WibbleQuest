Hello!

I want to :

Create a room
--------------------------------
Room * openingRoom = [[Room alloc] init];
openingRoom.id = @"start";
openingRoom.name = @"Backstage, at the venue.";
openingRoom.description = @"There are clothes all over the floor, and you can hear people practicing through the southern door.";
[wq addRoom:openingRoom];


Add a Person to talk to in a room
-------------------------------
Create the person's class, as a subclass of Person
Make them respond to words that are said by using 

-(void)respondToSentenceArray:(NSArray*)sentence {
  if([sentence contains:@"hi", @"hello", nil] ){
    [WQ print:@"Doc says, Oh wow, glad you've arrived!"];
    return;
  }
}

Make an item that you can pick up
---------------------------------
Create an Item subclass,
 

Make an item do something when picked up
---------------------------------
override onPickup in your class

-(void) onPickup{
  [WQ print:@"Bubba sloshes as you pick up his weighty cylindrical self"];
}

Make an item do a command
---------------------------------

Items can have their own commands if they support
