h3(#ready). Where do I put my code?

If you download one of the example applications, you'll see they have a folder for the WibbleQuest framework as well as a game folder. In the game folder there is a usually files called  [something]Game.m and [something]Game.h this is your main Game class, and where you do a lot of setting up your game. 

It will come with a method already called ready which is where you can safely set up your game. Once ready is finished then the game starts but saying your Game's Title and Description and puts the player in the first room.

h3. Write on the screen

Depending on what style of text you'll want to use these 6 commands on WQ

{% highlight objc %}
+(void) print:(NSString*)string, ...;
+(void) say:(NSString*)name words:(NSString*)words;
+(void) heading:(NSString*)string;
+(void) command:(NSString*)string;
+(void) title:(NSString*)string;
+(void) art:(NSString *)string;
{% endhighlight %}

For example

{% highlight objc %}
[WQ say:@"orta" words:@"hello there"];
[WQ print:@"looks like you picked up %i shoes", shoesCount];
[WQ heading:@"and so the story ends"];
{% endhighlight %}

h3(#ascii). I want to have some ASCII art (Like a map or a 'drawing')

Awesome, you can do that by using the art function on WQ, this will give you monospaced text, you have up to 32 characters per line (on the iPhone) and the lines are separated by dollar signs '$' the final gotcha is that all backslashes '\' have to be two backslashes '\\' as they are normally used to do things other than draw skeleton arms.

{% highlight objc %}
[wq art:@""
 "12345678901234567890123456789012$"
 "     ,--.            $"
 "     ([ oo]          $"
 "      `- ^\\         $"
 "     _ I`-'          $"
 "   ,o(`-V'           $"
 "   |( `-H-'          $"
 "   |(`--A-'          $"
 "   |(`-/_\'\\        $"
 "   O `'I ``\\\\      $"
 "   (\\  I    |\\,    $Â "
 "   \\\\-T-'`,        "];  
 {% endhighlight %}


h3(#id). What is the id property on all these objects for?

You use the object.id whenever you are trying to find a specific object like [Player has:@"itemID"] or [WQ findRoomByID:@"roomID"]. TLDR; always add one.

h3(#command). Make any object do a custom command

You want the Objject to override did respond to command. In this example it looks to see if the command is play and if it is, it says something. We the  return YES, otherwise it will continue to look for other commands.

{% highlight objc %}
-(BOOL)didRespondToCommand:(NSArray*)commandArray {
  NSString * command = [commandArray first];
  if ([@"play" isEqualToString:command]) {
    [WQ print:@"You rock out on the Keytar for a while playing some George Michaels, no one seems to pay any attention though"];
    return YES;
  }
  return NO;
}
{% endhighlight %}


h3. Find out what room I'm in 

You want to get access to the shared WibbleQuest object, and then call currentRoom on it

{% highlight objc %}
[WibbleQuest sharedWibble].currentRoom
{% endhighlight %}


h3(#createroom). Create a room

{% highlight objc %}
Room * openingRoom = [[Room alloc] init];
openingRoom.id = @"start";
openingRoom.name = @"Backstage, at the venue.";
openingRoom.description = @"There are clothes all over the floor, and you can hear people practicing through the southern door.";
[wq addRoom:openingRoom];
{% endhighlight %}


h3(#roomtalk). Make a room do something when you enter it

Make a room subclass, in it you can the override which will let you act when they leave / join

{% highlight objc %}
-(void)playerDidEnterRoom{}
-(void)playerDidLeaveRoom{}
{% endhighlight %}

If you want to control whether they can leave or join a room, you can override

{% highlight objc %}
-(BOOL)playerShouldEnterRoom;
-(BOOL)playerShouldLeaveRoom;
{% endhighlight %}

which expect a bool as to whether you can move out or in. These do not say anything so that's left to the room to deal with informing the player why.


h3(#teleport). Move to another room

You can use teleport to room with ID, make sure to have done [wq addRoom: room] and that the room has an id and everything should be fine

{% highlight objc %}
[Player teleportToRoomWithID:@"magicroom"];
{% endhighlight %}


h3(#roomexamine). Make it possible to examine things in the room

You need to subclass the Room object and add the method _dictionaryForExamine_. For example, this one says something if you write "examine clothes" in the room.

{% highlight objc %}
-(NSDictionary*)dictionaryForExamine {
return [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:
@"The clothes are sweaty, you don't really want to touch them", @"clothes",
nil];
}
{% endhighlight %}

h3(#deny). Make a room deny entry until you've got certain items

In your Room subclass you can ban someone to enter the room by returning NO. You also have a way of not letting someone leave the room, by using _playerShouldLeaveRoom_.

{% highlight objc %}
-(BOOL)playerShouldEnterRoom {
  if ([Player has:@"keytar"] && [Player has:@"microphone"]) {
    return YES;
  }
  
  [WQ print:@"You wouldn't want to go on stage without a Mic and your Keytar! Better go find them."];
  return NO;
}
{% endhighlight %}

h3(#say). Add a Person to talk to you in a room

Create the person's class, as a subclass of Person
Make them respond to words that are said by using 

{% highlight objc %}
-(void)respondToSentenceArray:(NSArray*)sentence {
  if([sentence contains:@"hi", @"hello", nil] ){
    [WQ print:@"Doc says, Oh wow, glad you've arrived!"];
    return;
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}


h3. make a person give you something

You can just add an item to the players inventory for example like below

{% highlight objc %}
if([sentence contains:@"mic", @"mics", @"microphone", nil] ){
  [WQ say:@"FloatstarPX" words:@"Ah yeah, the microphones, I spotted them earlier, here you go"];
  Microphone *mic = [[Microphone alloc] init];
  WibbleQuest * wibble = [WibbleQuest sharedWibble];
  [wibble.inventory addItem: mic];
  
  return;
}
{% endhighlight %}


h3. Make an item that you can pick up in a room

Create an Item subclass, add it to a room's inventory, it can have multiple items.
 
{% highlight objc %}
Room * bathroom = [[Room alloc] init];
bathroom.name = @"Bathroom"; 
Keytar *keytar = [[Keytar alloc] init];
[bathroom addItem:keytar];  
{% endhighlight %}



h3(#pickup). Make an item do something when picked up or dropped

override onPickup in your class

{% highlight objc %}
-(void) onPickup{
  [WQ print:@"Bubba sloshes as you pick up his weighty self"];
}

-(void) onDrop{
  [WQ print:@"You politely return to the floor"];
}
{% endhighlight %}


h3. Allow the player to use an object

override the method and that will be called when the player does "use [item]"

{% highlight objc %}
-(void)onUse{ }
{% endhighlight %}


h3(#talk). Make a person that you can talk to

Create a subclass of Person, make them respond using the following method

{% highlight objc %}
-(void)respondToSentenceArray:(NSArray*)sentence;
{% endhighlight %}

you can use the helpful method array contains to allow people to dig deeply into the conversation tree, or to allow them to react to multiple words with the same speech.


h3(#hello). Make a person say Hello the first time you enter a room

In your person subclass override 

{% highlight objc %}

-(void)playerEntersSameRoom {}

{% endhighlight %}

and make it say something
