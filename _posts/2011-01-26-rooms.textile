title: "Rooms"

A lot of the time you won't need to subclass a Room object, you can "create":#createroom a room easily, it's normal to only create a subclass when you want to "allow / disallow":#roomtalk, add respond to "examine":#roomexamine to the room or add your own "commands":#command inside the room.

Rooms have a name and description that is called when you enter that room, and they also have an "id":#id so you can get them using getRoomByID on the WQ class.

{% highlight objc %}
Room* finale = [WQ getRoomByID:@"finale"];
