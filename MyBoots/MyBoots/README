Hello!

I want to :

Create a room
--------------------------------
Room * openingRoom = [[Room alloc] init];
openingRoom.id = @"start";
openingRoom.name = @"Backstage, at the venue.";
openingRoom.description = @"There are clothes all over the floor, and you can hear people practicing through the southern door.";
[wq addRoom:openingRoom];


Make a room do something when you enter it
--------------------------------
Make a room subclass, in it you can the override which will let you act when they leave / join

-(void)playerDidEnterRoom{}
-(void)playerDidLeaveRoom{}

If you want to control whether they can leave or join a room, you can override

-(BOOL)playerShouldEnterRoom;
-(BOOL)playerShouldLeaveRoom;

which expect a bool as to whether you can move out or in. These do not say anything so that's left to the room to deal with informing the player why.

Add a Person to talk to in a room
-------------------------------
Create the person's class, as a subclass of Person
Make them respond to words that are said by using 

-(void)respondToSentenceArray:(NSArray*)sentence {
  if([sentence contains:@"hi", @"hello", nil] ){
    [WQ print:@"Doc says, Oh wow, glad you've arrived!"];
    return;
  }
}

make a person give you something
--
You can just add an item to the players inventory for example like below

if([sentence contains:@"mic", @"mics", @"microphone", @"microphones", nil] ){
  [WQ say:@"FloatstarPX" words:@"Ah yeah, the microphones, I spotted them earlier, here you go"];
  Microphone *mic = [[Microphone alloc] init];
  WibbleQuest * wibble = [WibbleQuest sharedWibble];
  [wibble.inventory addItem: mic];
  
  return;
}


Make an item that you can pick up in a room
---------------------------------
Create an Item subclass, add it to a room's inventory, it can have multiple items.
 
Room * bathroom = [[Room alloc] init];
bathroom.name = @"Bathroom"; 
Keytar *keytar = [[Keytar alloc] init];
[bathroom addItem:keytar];  



Make an item do something when picked up
---------------------------------
override onPickup in your class

-(void) onPickup{
  [WQ print:@"Bubba sloshes as you pick up his weighty cylindrical self"];
}

Make an item do a command
---------------------------------


Make a person that you can talk to
--

Create a subclass of Person, make them respond using the following method

-(void)respondToSentenceArray:(NSArray*)sentence;


Make a person say Hello the first time you enter a room
--
In your person subclass override 
-(void)playerEntersSameRoom {}
and make it say something



Items can have their own commands if they support
