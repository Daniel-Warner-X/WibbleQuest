h1. Wibble Quest website

Want to contribute? Load Terminal, get to your projects folder, do _git clone https://orta@github.com/orta/WibbleQuest.git_

It's a Jekyll site, so make sure you have a copy of ruby 1.9.2 ( "get rvm":https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/ ) and that you've ran  _gem install jeykll_ 

Loading the site locally is simply a matter of then going to that folder and typing _jekyll server_ and browsing to "_http://localhost:4000_":http://localhost:4000
